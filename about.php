			<h3>Who  <span>We Are ?</span></h3>
			 We take this opportunity to introduce ourselves as one of the leading buying and selling the products in Nepal, having a fully-equipped facility.A website that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service. It’s tough to imagine daily life without e-commerce.The term “e-commerce” simply means the sale of goods or services on the internet. In its most basic form, e-commerce involves electronically transferring funds and data between 2 or more parties. This form of business has evolved quite a bit since its beginnings in the electronic data interchange of the 1960s and the inception of online shopping in the 1990s.
